### Data Retention to the API vs S3 Access

Currently the API only supports a rolling 90 day archive of the data. For access to the full dataset, you can access directly S3 by going [here](https://openaq-fetches.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) or [here](https://openaq-data.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html).
